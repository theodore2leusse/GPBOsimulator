# GPBOsimulator


## Objective    

In this folder, our objective is to perform simulations of neurostimulation with different settings and to evaluate the performance of these settings. This folder allows us to quantify the performance of the chosen settings based on the following criteria:
- We want each iteration of the Bayesian optimization to be short in duration.
- We want the complexity of our surrogate model to be low: a classical GP has cubic complexity with respect to the size of the training dataset, and we want the complexity to be as low as possible.
- We want our optimization to be sample-efficient, converging to the optimum with a minimum number of queries, i.e., in a minimum number of iterations.
    - Does the model find the optimum?
    - How do the exploration and exploitation evolve during the simulation?

The main file is `SimGPBO.py`, where you can find the class `SimGPBO`, which will allow us to run simulations and save all important information into `.npz` files. These files can be found in the `results` folder.

`SimGPBO` class performs simulations on actual data maps that have been extracted from `.mat` files (data available here: https://osf.io/54vhx/) using the `Dataset` class. This class is used in the `simulation.ipynb` notebook.

`Postprocessor` class performs post processing with the `.npz` files in the `results` folder. This class is used in the `results.ipynb` notebook.

`QueriesInfo` class allows to use a SVGP (sparse variational gaussian process) that we will use in the methods `estimated_gpytorch_gpbo` & `estimated_hp_gpytorch_gpbo` from `SimGPBO` class. 

`NNasOnlineGP` class allows to use a NN as an online GP that we will use in the method `NN_gpbo` from `SimGPBO` class.


## Overview

This folder contains:
- 4 python files : `DataSet.py`, `NNasOnlineGP.py`, `NNutils.py`, `Postprocessor.py`, `QueriesInfo.py` & `SimGPBO.py`,
- 3 jupyter notebooks : `simulation.ipynb`, `simuNN.ipynb` et `results.ipynb`.
- 1 folder dataset wich stores lots of different `*.pth` and `*.pkl` datasets.
- 1 folder model that stores weigths of models in `*.pth` files.

The project is organized as follows:
